                Hello! I&apos;m Daniel Yu, a junior at the University of Maryland, College Park studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
                This past summer I had the opportunity to intern at Workday as a part of their Enterprise Identity Team, focusing on 
                Identity and Access Management. At school, I am involved with a club called Hack4Impact, where I help build software for non-profits.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                Outside of my academic and career pursuits, I love keeping up with the latest advancements in technology, and working on personal projects
                where I can hone my skills and apply them to topics I like. In my free time,
                I love playing pickleball and going climbing. I also love following baseball and am a huge Orioles fan!
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hi! Cheers!
